Based on https://github.com/paulklinkenberg/lucee-loganalyzer

- It's published on (ForgeBox)[https://www.forgebox.io/view/LuceeLogViewer] and available via the Lucee Administrator
## Hacking and Building
The Build process uses (Apache Ant)[https://ant.apache.org/] 

Simply run ant in the root directory to build the .lex file which you can manually install via the Lucee Administrator

Once installed, all the source files can be found and hacked under the server or web contexts (i.e under WEB-INF)

C:\lucee\tomcat\lucee-server\context\context\admin\plugin\logViewer
